Remarks:
* This is the revised version of my bachelorâ€™s final-year project. You can see my original paper published on the IEEE website at this [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10322320/references#references).
* All explanations are in the MainCodePart_1.ipynb and MainCodePart_2.ipynb. You can follow through every step inside those files. 
* You may need this [pre-trained SwingNet model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AlcYPYHZMQcCWSrFtnabNDjhKI-GCsSZ/view?usp=share_link) in MainCodePart_1.ipynb.
* Feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or feedback!
